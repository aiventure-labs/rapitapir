# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## What Was Wrong

The GitHub Pages deployment was failing with a 404 error because:
1. GitHub Pages was not enabled in the repository settings
2. The workflow YAML had syntax issues
3. The deployment pattern was outdated

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated Workflow (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`)
- ✅ Fixed YAML syntax errors
- ✅ Updated to modern GitHub Pages deployment pattern
- ✅ Added proper permissions and concurrency settings
- ✅ Separated build and deploy jobs
- ✅ Added environment configuration
- ✅ Simplified HTML generation to avoid YAML conflicts

### 2. Enhanced Documentation
- ✅ Created GitHub Pages setup instructions (`docs/github_pages_setup.md`)
- ✅ Created beautiful HTML documentation for SinatraRapiTapir (`docs/sinatra_rapitapir.html`)
- ✅ Added clean index page with proper navigation

### 3. Workflow Features
- 📖 Generates YARD API documentation
- 🎨 Creates OpenAPI documentation placeholder
- 🏗️ Builds a clean documentation website
- 📤 Uploads to GitHub Pages
- 🚀 Deploys automatically on push to main

## Next Steps

**You need to enable GitHub Pages in repository settings:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/riccardomerolla/rapitapir/settings/pages
2. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
3. Save the configuration

Once enabled, the workflow will automatically:
- Build documentation on every push to main
- Deploy to: https://riccardomerolla.github.io/rapitapir/
- Include our new SinatraRapiTapir documentation

## Files Changed

- `.github/workflows/docs.yml` - Fixed and modernized
- `docs/github_pages_setup.md` - Setup instructions  
- `docs/sinatra_rapitapir.html` - Beautiful HTML documentation
- `docs/sinatra_rapitapir.md` - Existing markdown documentation

The workflow is now robust and will work correctly once GitHub Pages is enabled!
